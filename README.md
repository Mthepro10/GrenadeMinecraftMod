# About

This mod expands Minecraft’s explosive gameplay by giving players direct, intentional control over chaos.

Instead of relying purely on environmental TNT or unpredictable mobs, you gain tools that let you decide when, where, and how explosions happen. Every item is designed to feel like it belongs in vanilla Minecraft—dangerous when misused, powerful when mastered.

From controlled demolition to summoning nature’s most volatile mob, this mod turns explosions into a tactical choice rather than an accident.


# Features

## Grenades  
Throwable explosives that behave like compact, player-controlled TNT.

They are made for fast-paced combat and terrain clearing, allowing you to react instantly instead of placing and igniting TNT. Grenades reward positioning, timing, and awareness.

## Friend of the Bombs Potion  
A short burst of explosive immunity that affects only the player who drinks it.

For exactly 2 seconds, you become immune to explosion damage. Fire, fall damage, and mob attacks still hurt, making this potion a precise survival tool rather than a safety net.

## Creeper Whistle  
A simple whistle with terrifying consequences.

When used, it summons a charged creeper, as if struck by lightning. It is not tamed, controlled, or friendly—it behaves exactly like a naturally charged creeper. The whistle exists for players who want raw power at their fingertips and are willing to accept the risks.


# Gameplay Use Cases

Aggressive combat with grenades  
Safe demolition using short-term explosion immunity  
High-risk PvE encounters using summoned charged creepers  
Tactical scenarios where timing and positioning matter more than armor


# Design Philosophy

All mechanics follow vanilla rules:
Explosions remain dangerous  
Creepers behave exactly like normal charged creepers  
Immunity is short, personal, and situational  

The goal is to enhance explosive gameplay without breaking Minecraft’s balance or survival feel.


# Notes

Explosion immunity lasts exactly 2 seconds  
The potion only affects the player who consumes it  
Other damage types are unaffected  
Intended to feel balanced and consistent with vanilla mechanics
