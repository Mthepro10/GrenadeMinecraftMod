# Explosion King

Explosion King expands Minecraft’s explosive gameplay by giving players direct, intentional control over explosions—without breaking vanilla balance.

Instead of relying on placed TNT or mob behavior, players gain tools that make explosions a tactical choice: dangerous when misused, powerful when mastered.

## Features

### Grenades
Throwable, compact explosives for fast combat and terrain clearing. Designed for timing, positioning, and quick reactions.

### Friend of the Bombs Potion
Grants exactly 2 seconds of explosion immunity to the drinker only. Other damage types still apply, keeping usage precise and risky.

### Creeper Whistle
Summons a fully charged creeper on use. It is hostile, uncontrolled, and behaves exactly like a naturally charged creeper.

## Gameplay Focus

- Fast-paced combat with grenades  
- Controlled demolition via short-term immunity  
- High-risk PvE using charged creepers  
- Skill-based timing and positioning over raw armor  

## Design Philosophy

- Follows vanilla mechanics  
- Explosions remain lethal  
- Creepers behave exactly like vanilla charged creepers  
- Effects are short, personal, and situational  

Balanced to feel native to survival Minecraft.
